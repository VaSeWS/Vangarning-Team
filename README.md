## How to launch
In project's directory use one of the following:
```
python terminal_interface.py {name}
python terminal_interface.py {name} {game}
python terminal_interface.py {username} {game} {num_turns} {num_players}
```

Or you can modify `__name__ == "__main__"` part of game_client.py as you wish and launch it from there.
